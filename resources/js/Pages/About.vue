                    <p>
                        As you may have guessed, I am stux. A few years ago I deleted my Facebook account and started
                        looking for a better alternative.
                        <br /><br />
                        When I came across Mastodon I was instantly sold. For years I have been trying to create or host
                        some form of social platform but failed every single time.
                        Mastodon made self-hosting much easier and it was able to connect with something amazing called
                        'The Fediverse' or Federated Universe. This means everyone can host their own server(network)
                        and connect with other networks out there!
                    </p>
                    <p class="mt-4">
                        Currently I run a variaty of services on the internet, most of them are free open source services
                        to give people a privacy-friendly alternative to bigger mainsteam services.
